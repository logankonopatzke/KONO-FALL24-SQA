## Lessons Learned

- I have learned how to effectively setup pre-commit tasks to be able to run actions before code is pushed
- I have also figured out how to use GitHub Actions better and more effectively
- Another I learned with this is setting the proper parameters in the GH Actions yaml file
- I also learned how to fix Github actions when they are failing/when there is a broke pipeline
- The methods I tested and fuzzed all seemed to have the correct output. However, I first thought that I had encountered an issue when I was initially testing the timestamp method. Upon taking a closer look and refining my code, the issue was resolved.
- I also learned how to do proper logging to a file instead of just going to the command line
- Finally, I got to practice logging data to a file as a method of doing forensics
