- I have learned how to effectively setup pre-commit tasks to be able to run actions before code is pushed
- I have also figured out how to use GitHub Actions better and more effectively
- Another I learned with this is setting the proper parameters in the GH Actions yaml file
- I also learned how to fix Github actions when they are failing/when there is a broke pipeline
